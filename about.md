Hi, my name is Ray and this is my blog for math and CS related topics. I believe that you don't _really_ know what you're talking about unless you can present the information in a digestible and intuitive way. In order to ensure I really know the material I learned, I compile them in blogposts here. Some of these blogposts somehow got traction on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/gpj1sk/analyzing_the_simplest_c_program/) and [hackernews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17010314), and has been [translated in multiple languages](https://blog.csdn.net/dev_csdn/article/details/78500708). I'm thankful for the appreciative emails, and I've recently just added a comment functionality to my blog!

I graduated from UCLA as a computer science major. I'm a huge math geek and I used to take
too many math classes for fun. My interests span from theoretical mathematics to machine learning to learning about the linux kernel.

Most of the time, I write on this blog because I'm too lazy to take on some huge project and just want to chill and learn some fun stuff that's sometimes not useful.

I recently started a job at **[Hudson River Trading (HRT)](https://www.hudsonrivertrading.com)** in New York as an Algorithm Engineer, working with (and learning from) people who are probably much smarter than me. I previously interned at some companies including [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/), [Citadel Securities](https://www.citadelsecurities.com/), [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/) etc, so I have had a sizeable amount of time working on teams that focus on scientific computing and performance. I worked a year at Airbnb on the machine learning infrastructure team and I learned lots from my peers.

If you have questions about what I wrote in my blog, don't hesitate to shoot me a message at rayzhang@g.ucla.edu or just leave a comment on the blog. I'm just a human, so I make typos!
