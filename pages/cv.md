I am currently conducting research on summarization of multimodal presentations, for my PhD at Centrale Supélec / Université Paris-Saclay, under the supervision of Frédéric Dufaux and Camille Guinaudeau.

## Tools

During my PhD, I developed multiple tools to process and study the summarization of multimodal presentations by leveraging their structure. I packaged some of those tools in a [**github repo**](https://github.com/giganttheo/mmmmmm), including methods for slide extraction from presentation records, speech recognition, and the construction of a structured multimodal representation, a cost-effective multimodal input for VLMs.

In 2022 I participated in the preprocessing of several datasets as part of the [BigScience Research Workshop](https://bigscience.huggingface.co/), which resulted in two publications:
