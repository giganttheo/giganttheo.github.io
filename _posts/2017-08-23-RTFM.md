## But for reals

I genuinely believe that millions of hours are wasted every year because people don't read the documentation. Actually - noone reads the documentation, that's why StackOverflow has billions of page views!

If people read the manual, and found an undocumented bug, then sure. **But the truth is, people ask questions without googling/man-paging them.** 

I'm a culprit too - I wasted so many hours because I _assumed_ what was on the specs of a CS project(Prof. Nachenberg's 60-something page specs), or I asked someone for help without reading docs. 

On stack overflow, the majority of the answers are _"how about you try this instead", rather than fixing your actual issue_, which doesn't help when you have rules.

So yeah, RTFM, it's good for you.

# Sphinx

A simple, intuitive documentation tool is **sphinx**. It's used for the entire python docs, and much more. It's well supported, allows doctesting in python, supports LaTeX, and much more.

## Get Started

To start with one, make sure your `pip` version is up to date. Right now, I have this:

```
~ $ pip install sphinx
...
~ $ python -c "import sphinx; print(sphinx.__version__)"     
1.5.6
```

Let's make a sphinx doc:

```
~ $ sphinx-quickstart
```

It will ask you for a couple(lots) of options in commandline before initializing itself. Most of these can be changed manually in its `conf.py` file, so don't sweat it if you feel like you've made a mistake.

## Directory Structure

```
docs
- build # empty unless built, also optional
- source
	- conf.py
	- index.rst # unless you specified otherwise
	- {prefix}static # prefix = _ unless specified
	- {prefix}templates # prefix = _ unless specified
- Makefile
```

Usually, documentation should be in a folder called `docs` inside of your github repo, which contains 2 folders `build`, and `source` if you decided to segregate them, and no `build` otherwise. 

## Important Files

### Makefile
The `Makefile` at the base of the `docs` directory is very important. It does a couple of things:

`$ make clean` : removes all the built items inside of your `build` folder, defined by `BUILDDIR`.

`$ make html` : creates the html you need for people to view it online.

`$ make singlehtml` : if you wanted a giant page. But why?

`$ make latex` : try writing your homework!

`$ make man` : make a man page out of your docs!

There's a lot more `make` commands. I've only used these, and you can find out the other exportable times via `$ make`, which is just a help page.

We will add a **custom Makefile command later in the blog, to export it to github pages.**

### conf.py
The `conf.py` file is just a file of definitions.

For most purposes an `.ini` file would work fine, but it seems like sphinx, being built _for python_, decided to use a more flexible configuration file. They probably import the module variables into a script called by `make`.

If you made a mistake in your configurations upon startup, you can change them here. For example, I decided to try to export my project to github pages, so I had to add this extension:

```python
extensions = ['sphinx.ext.autodoc', 'sphinx.ext.githubpages']
```

inside of `conf.py`. There are way too many options for me to list them, so take a look at it if you're interested.

### {index}.{rst/txt}
Depending on what postfix you wanted for your files, and what filename you wanted for your main landing page to display, you will get this file. For now, let's assume it's `index.rst`. 

**In sphinx, you don't use `.md` files. `.rst` is "RestructuredText", and boasts a couple more extensions than markdown at the cost of syntax.**

You can add  things to the `toctree`, which is an `.rst` macro to look for other `.rst` files and generate linking on the landing page. 

For example, if we want to reference `license.rst` and `help.rst`:

```
.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   license
   help
```

+ Note that the **`l` in `license` and `h` in `help` are alligned with the `:` in `:maxdepth: 2`**! It won't work if you don't allign like that.
+ Note that you need titles in the other .rst files, which have a `===` underline to them.
+ If you set `:maxdepth:` to 1, you'll only see main titles, and if you set it to 2, you'll see main titles and subtitles, and etc.

In general, RestructuredText is a pretty complicated markdown language. I find these sources to be pretty helpful when writing docs:

+ [docutils source](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickref.html)
+ [rst cheatsheet](https://github.com/ralsina/rst-cheatsheet/blob/master/rst-cheatsheet.rst)
+ [sphinx's own primer on rst](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/rest.html)


## Quick Look

We can simply run `$ make html` as specified before and spin up some `index.html`'s inside of the build folder. 

A convenient alias is the following:
```
alias chrome="open -a 'Google Chrome'"
```

Let's open our html with chrome to see how it looks. An example I made looks like: 


```
build $ chrome index.html
```
![index]({{ site.url }}/assets/rtdindex.png)

Which looks great already! There are custom themes you can try out, but I roll with the OG.

## Upload onto ReadTheDocs

ReadTheDocs is a great service that allows us to host our sphinx documentation. It's seamlessly integrated with sphinx. All you need to do is to visit [readthedocs](readthedocs.org).

## Upload onto github pages

Now this is a pain. It's a little brittle in directory structure, but great documentation can be found on [here](https://daler.github.io/sphinxdoc-test/includeme.html). What the tutorial does is the following:

+ Creates a new repository with the proper `.git` and `.gitignore` files **where our build would usually be**.
	+ Alternatively, you can also clone the repository and point `BUILDDIR` to it.
+ Creates a `git branch` called `gh-pages`. Github uses this to create its pages(there are other options, but they're not very flexible). 
+ Removes all the files in the current branch, and whenever we build html into this folder, it can be committed & pushed into the branch.
+ Adds a makefile command to commit the github page changes. 

So now that you've got your docs online, the _desired audience_ will now refer to your documentations, and noone will add github issues on things your FAQ's already answer! Thanks Chairman Mao!
