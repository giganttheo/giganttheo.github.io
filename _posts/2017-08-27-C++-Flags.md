title: Back To C++ & Clang Flags

This is a series of blog posts to help myself keep track of what I'm about to learn in C++. I'm starting out with the most basic things, to set up my environment and allow for easy debugging.

# Why Flags?

Usually, if I were to create a simple `.cpp` file, I would compile like this:

```
~ $ g++ helloworld.cpp
~ $ ./a.out
hello world!
```

But if we got multiple cpp files in the same place, compiling into different binaries, this would get confusing. It's better to do:

```
~ $ g++ helloworld.cpp -o helloworld
~ $ ./helloworld
hello world!
```

If we had multiple c++ files to import, we would have this:

```
~ $ g++ helloworld.cpp helper.cpp -o helloworld
~ $ ./helloworld
hello world!
```

Now, this is about all that I used to use during C++ development. **This is what 90% of people in college do, but apparently this isn't the case in the workplace.** The workplace uses a bucketload of flags to allow for debugging, custom compiler instructions, enforcing security, etc.
