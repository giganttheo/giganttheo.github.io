**Note: This post is introductory computer science. For those who understand hardware system design you probably don't want to read this.**

## Timeline 
...
In 1947, the transistor was invented and they used it to create an **electronic switch**. It becomes the building blocks for the future analog systems.

In 1959, there was a patent for an **integrated circuit**, or as we call a computer microchip. It integrates multiple devices into one package, including transistors.
...

## Hardware Systems

**Q: What is hardware?**
**A:** 
Hardware: A physical system, simple model of inputs and outputs.
inputs --> system --> outputs

**Q: What is analog vs digital?**
**A:**
Digital: Has discrete input/output values. 
- e.x. only 0 and 1 are used in computer systems. Is an abstraction of what's really going on.

Analog: Has continuous input/output values.
- e.x. real electronic components exhibit analog behavior. Your voice, image, etc are all analog variables.

**Q: What is combinational vs sequential?**
**A:**
Combinational: A digital circuit is combinational if current output depends on input values. It has no memory! 
e.x. AND/OR gates

Sequential: Exhibit behaviors that depend not only on current inputs but also previous
note: In reality, all circuits are sequential.

**Q: Synchronous vs Asynchronous??**
**A:**
Synchronous: Outputs change at prescribed time instant.

Asynchronous: Outputs can change at any time instant.

## Big Picture of Digital Systems Design
** Idea --> Specification --> Logic Design --> Physical Design --> Fabrication **

_Specification_ : A goal.

_Logic Design_ : Trying to describe the high-level capabilities of the system on paper.

_Physical Design_ : Trying to specify the implementation of the system.

_Fabrication_ : Create the system physically.

## Example: Calendar subsystem
** Idea: Number of days in a month to control watch display **

_inputs_ : month, leap year flag.

_outputs_ : number of days.

In a software implementation it's pretty simple:

```c++
switch(month):
	case 1:
    	if(flag){
        	return 31;
        }
    ...
    case 12:
    ...
}
```

How do we do this in a hardware perspective?

- We have the numbers of 28,29,30,31 as the possible outputs.
	- We can use 4 for these as one-hot encodings. [0 0 1 0] means the 3rd number, [1 0 0 0] means the 1st number, etc.

- We have 1,2,3...12 for the months, and 0,1 for the flag.
	- We can use 4 bits for 1,2,3...12, since 2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 16.
    - We can use 1 bit for 0, 1 for the flag.
    
- This system is combinational. Use a truth table for this:

## Data Representation

We are building up a **computer system**. They behave using the binary number system. How do we map the high level into low level binary number system?

Some common terms for binary data:

- Nibble = 4 bits.
- Bytes = 8 bits. (a.k.a octet)
- Word = 32 bits.

Representation of characters:

- 7 bits ASCII : 128 characters, alphabets, numbers, etc
- 8 bits EBCDIC : 256 characters, IBM's own ASCII type
- 16 bits UniCode : Translational purposes

Another idea: Encoding/Decoding - find encoding scheme and chop the strings at the boundaries and look up its definition.

Number systems:
- Sign-value system: Like roman numerals, e.g. I, II, III, IV, ...
- Positional Number system: what we use - it tells us the position on the number line.

{Positive/Neg, Integer/Fraction} --> Number --> Positional Number System --> Radix --> {Mixed/fixed, Neg,Positive}.
